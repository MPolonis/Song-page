        <h2>Fear of the dark</h2>
        <p>
            I am a man who walks alone<br> 
            And when I'm walking a dark road<br>
            At night or strolling through the park<br>
            When the light beginsto change<br> 
            I sometimes feel a little strange<br> 
            A little anxious when it's dark<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
            I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br> 
            I have a phobia that someone's always there
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you run your fingers down the wall<br> 
            And have you felt your neck skin crawl<br>
            When you're searching for the light?<br> 
            Sometimes when you're scared to take a look<br> 
            At the corner of the room<br> 
            You've sensed that something's watching you<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
            I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
            I have a phobia that someone's always there<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you ever been alone at night 
            Thought you heard footsteps behind 
            And turned around and no one's there? 
            And as you quicken up your pace 
            You find it hard to look again 
            Because you're sure there's someone there
        </p>
        <p>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
            I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
            I have a phobia that someone's always there<br>
        </p>
