        <h2>Fear of the dark</h2>
        <p>
            I am a man who walks alone<br> 
            And when I'm walking a dark road<br>
            At night or strolling through the park<br>
            When the light beginsto change<br> 
            I sometimes feel a little strange<br> 
            A little anxious when it's dark<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
            I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
            Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br> 
            I have a phobia that someone's always there
