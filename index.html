            <p>
                I am a man who walks alone<br> 
                And when I'm walking a dark road<br>
                At night or strolling through the park<br>
                When the light beginsto change<br> 
                I sometimes feel a little strange<br> 
                A little anxious when it's dark<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
                I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br> 
                I have a phobia that someone's always there
            </p>
            <p>
                Have you run your fingers down the wall<br> 
                And have you felt your neck skin crawl<br>
                When you're searching for the light?<br> 
                Sometimes when you're scared to take a look<br> 
                At the corner of the room<br> 
                You've sensed that something's watching you<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
                I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
                I have a phobia that someone's always there<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Have you ever been alone at night<br>
                Thought you heard footsteps behind<br>
                And turned around and no one's there?<br>
                And as you quicken up your pace<br>
                You find it hard to look again<br>
                Because you're sure there's someone there<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
                I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
                I have a phobia that someone's always there<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Watching horror films the night before<br>
                Debating witches and folklores<br>
                The unknown troubles on your mind<br>
                Maybe your mind is playing tricks<br>
                You sense, and suddenly eyes fix<br>
                On dancing shadows from behind<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
                I have a constant fear that something's always near<br>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br>
                I have a phobia that someone's always there<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br> 
                I have a constant fear that something's always near<br> 
                Fear of the dark, fear of the dark<br> 
                I have a phobia that someone's always there<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm walking a dark road<br>
                I am a man who walks alone.<br>
